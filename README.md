I used React to design a simple social App similar to facebook.com, which includes a login page, a profile page, and a home page. The website allows user to create their account and follow/unfollow another user as well as post whatever they want. When you go to your friend's page, you can also see his post. Skills: HTML, CSS(flex), JavaScript, React, React Router version 6, RESTful APIs, Axios, MongoDB, node.js.
